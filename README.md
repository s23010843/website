### **Explanation of Markdown:**
1. `#` and `##` are used to create headers (e.g., `#` for the main title and `##` for subsections).
2. `-` is used for bullet points.
3. Code blocks are wrapped in triple backticks (```) for commands or code snippets.
4. **Bold** text is done with `**`.

### How to Use:
1. **Create a `README.md` file** in your project folder.
2. **Copy and paste** the above content into the file.
3. **Add, commit, and push** it to GitHub:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README file"
git push origin main
```
---

### **Result:**
Once you push it to GitHub, your README.md will appear with proper formatting, like headers, bullet points, and code blocks.
